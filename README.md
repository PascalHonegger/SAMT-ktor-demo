# SAMT Ktor Demo

This is a demo project for a SAMT Ktor server and client project.

## SAMT model

The SAMT model is located in the [model](./model) directory.
It can be generated by running SAMT on the [samt.yaml](./model/samt.yaml) file:

```bash
cd model
./samtw compile
```

## Server

A simple [Ktor](https://ktor.io/) server, which uses the generated SAMT provider to implement a basic greeter endpoint.
It can be started by using the `Start Server` IntelliJ run configuration, or using the following CLI command:

```bash
./gradlew ktor-server:run
```

## Client

A simple application which calls the server using the generated SAMT consumer.
It can be started by using the `Start Client` IntelliJ run configuration, or using the following CLI command:

```bash
./gradlew ktor-client:run
```
